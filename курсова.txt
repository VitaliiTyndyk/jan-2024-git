The Simpsons (often shortened to Simpsons) is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The main characters are a satire of a working-class family, consisting of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The series lampoons many aspects of American culture, society, politics, and history.

Bartholomew JoJo "Bart" Simpson (born April 1 ,1979 or February 23, 1979) is the mischievous, rebellious, misunderstood, disruptive and "potentially dangerous" oldest child of the Simpson family in The Simpsons. He is the only son of Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie. He also has been nicknamed "Cosmo", after discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart has also been on the cover on numerous comics, such as "Critical Hit", "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". Bart also has a 100-issue comic series entitled the Simpson Comics Presents Bart Simpson. Bart is loosely based on Matt Groening and his older brother, Mark Groening.

Even at a young age, Bart has accomplished many feats. He has won an award for his Angry Dad web series[7], he has discovered a new comet which was named after him[8], and he also has performed in a successful band with Milhouse Van Houten, Nelson Muntz, and Ralph Wiggum.[9]
